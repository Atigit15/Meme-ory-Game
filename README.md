<!-- ### Code for backend
The backend code includes RESTful API endpoints for fetching data related to KPIs, products, and transactions. It connects to the MongoDB database using Mongoose and follows best practices for code organization and structure.

## Database Design

### Database used
The application uses MongoDB, a popular NoSQL document-based database, for storing data.

### Database schema and Tables used
The database has three collections: KPI, Product, and Transaction. The schemas for these collections are defined using Mongoose.

- The KPI schema stores the total profit, revenue, expenses, and monthly and daily data.
- The Product schema contains information about the products, including their name, price, and description.
- The Transaction schema stores transactional data such as date, revenue, and expenses.## Screenshots
